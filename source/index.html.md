# Introduction

Welcome to the Edgar API! You can use our API to access Edgar API endpoints, which can get information on various Edgar Files in our Database.

We have language bindings in Shell and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```python
import edgar

api = edgar.authorize('yourkey')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: yourkey"
```

> Make sure to replace `yourkey` with your API key.

Edgar uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Edgar API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Edgar expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: yourkey`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>yourkey</code> with your personal API key.
